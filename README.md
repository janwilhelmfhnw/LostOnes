# About KinoReview

## Who we are

We are a group of four eager students who want to develop a web application that is responsive and well-designed. 
We are currently at the end of our third semester in our studies of Business Information Technology and this is our term project. 


## What are we trying to accomplish? 

During the lectures in our Internet Technology class, we formed the idea of creating a web-app for Movie reviews and discussions about them. 
For us, the most challenging part would be to create a responsive site that offers a lot of variation concerning the interaction of movie enthusiasts. 
This project is basically an overhaul of the reference project made by Mr. Martin, one of our lecturers. So the basics of a web-application like a login form or a customer database are already there. Our goal is to enhance the look of the website with the help of bootstrap and integrate some other functionalities that are needed for a movie review site. 


## Requirements analysis 

**Functional Requirements:** 

Log-in form 

Store log-in data 

Store review data 

create a user account 

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

Corporate design with a movie theme 

low maintenance times

Secured login and data storage 

user-friendly interface

responsive layout

## Design Decision 

For our design, it was important to think about who our target audience is: Movie watchers. So these can be of any age group and therefore we wanted to make the design as fitting for all age groups as possible but at the same time it should look like a blockbuster: Shiny and well-polished. We then implemented the design in bootstrap that we wanted. The corporate design is based on movie backgrounds, which we thought was very fitting. The rest of the page should be in a rather unspectacular color so that the main focus is on the website content.

## Roadmap

Phase 1: Learn the basics
In the first phase, our goal is to understand the basics of internet technology. This includes studying the theory taught by Mr. Montecchiari and Mr. Martin and also scrutinizing the reference project and understanding how input and output look like when implementing different solutions. We also needed to learn the different applications and functions that are crucial for web development such as bootstrap, Heroku, javascript, and so on. An important part was also to find out what was really necessary and possible to implement in our project. 

Phase 2: The second phase consists of constant and small development steps that form the websites look more on how we expect them to look. The biggest difference in a website's look and feel can be created with bootstrap, which is a really nice tool for the overall look, design, and responsiveness of a web app. 

Phase 3: The third step is the polishing of our created infrastructure. We want to execute bugfixes and also enhance the overall look and feel of our web app. Here, the four-eyes principle is crucial. Many errors or human mistakes are not easy to perceive for the person committing them, so we have to check each other's work and realize what problems could occur and prevent them.

Phase 4: The last phase of our project is the go-live. This is the most exciting part of our project and the part when we finally make our web app publicly available, so everybody can rate and discuss his or her favorite movies. We don't expect the go-live to be perfectly seamless but we hope that we fixed the most problems in phase 3 already so that we do not have to apply too many post-release patches afterward. The goal for our go-live is to have an accessible and working web app where every functionality we wanted to implement is working properly 

## Page Structure
![Website Structure](https://github.com/Alexjames21/KinoProject/blob/master/MovieReview-web/src/main/resources/static/assets/img/gloomap_6ef335ba.png)

The website consists of 4 main pages: 

Featured: The featured page is at the same time also the home page. It shows a featured movie that is new or rated highly. 

Top Movies: Here, the top movies will be displayed and they can also be rated if you are logged in. 

Write your own review here: This page is a sub-page of featured, it can be used to write an own review for the selected movie.

Sign in: Here, the visitor can access his account or create a new account to write their own movie reviews.

Top Movies also has sub-pages to the different movies. These sites consist of a short description of the movie and from here, you are able to post your own reviews with a review form. After filling out the form, the review is displayed on the site of the reviewed movie.


## Reflection 

After having handed in the project, we want to reflect on various parts of the project.
The easiest part of the project was easily the HTML part. We already had the module Introduction to Bit and we learned there how to create HTML pages and also how CSS works. The HTML part is obviously only one part of our project. The biggest part was probably the logic behind the web app. We had a lot of problems with that. We were depressed a lot of times when things did not work out the way we wanted. In the end, Mr. Martin helped us to at least deploy the project on Heroku. The business logic did not work until the end, but you can see in the master branch what we tried there. We probably underestimated the workload and knowledge required to get everything to work until the due date. We still think that we learned a lot of new things and we also enjoyed the moments where something worked out as we wanted it. But there were also a lot of moments where we were lost and did not know how to continue. The deployment on Heroku was the most confusing thing: Sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not, sometimes parts of it worked and sometimes it looked all fine except for the logic behind it (Login, restricted sections, etc.). For the next time, we probably should meet more often virtually and discuss what we are working on and the best thing would be to have some kind of deadlines that everybody has to follow. But it is clear that group projects without any face to face interactions are hard to do.
